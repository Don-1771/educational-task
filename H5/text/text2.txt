Cuphead is a game based on continuous boss fights. The player character, Cuphead, has lost a bet with the devil and is trying to repay the debt. 
The game takes the form of a branching sequence of levels. Cuphead has an infinite number of attempts and does not lose his weapon upon death. 
The protagonist of the game has the ability to parry various objects coded in pink. Successful parries fill a special meter that allows him to perform a special ability. 
Levels are accessible through an action RPG style overworld that has its own secret paths.
